          <p>Congratulations! Your private key has been successfully recovered. Your private key is a critical part of your cryptographic identity. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its role:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> When you send a message, your private key is used to encrypt the data, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read it.</li>
              <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> When you receive a message, your private key is used to decrypt the data, allowing you to read messages securely sent to you.</li>
              <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Your private key also helps in verifying your identity when performing cryptographic operations, ensuring that your communications remain secure and authenticated.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is important to keep your private key safe and secure. Never share it with anyone, and always use a strong, unique password to protect it. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.</p>
